Ice Cream: Ice cream?
Chips: Chips! [The audience of rabbits laughs.] Chips. Ch-i-ips!
Ice cream: [Pats Ice Cream on the head] Ice cream!
Finn: I don't get it.
Jake: Ah, just keep watching. BMO said the second act gets crazy.
Chips: Chips chips chips. Chips chips... Chips!
Ice Cream: Ice cream! [Kisses the prop bird.]
Chips: [Kisses the prop bird and looks to the audience.] Chips...
Ice Cream: [Looks towards the audience] Ice cream...
BMO: [Pulls up some grass and throws it.] Bravo!
Jake: What the stuff was that?!
Morty Rogers: [Hops out of the stage carriage.] Now, who wants to invite me over for dinner?
Mother Rabbit: Come on, kids! We're going to grandma's.
Morty Rogers: [Sighs.]
BMO: Dinner?[Runs to Finn and Jake. Slides on their knees and puts their arms in a pleading gesture] Please can we invite him to dinner?
Jake: No.
BMO: But, Jake, I never ask you for anything. When did I ever ask you for anything?
Jake: Yesterday. You said, [Imitating BMO] "Jake, please take me to see Chips and Ice Cream! It's a Broadway smash!" And I believed you.
BMO: [Crying.] You don't understand me, Jake.
Morty Rogers: [Rubs two coins together and sighs.]
BMO: [Pokes Morty Rogers on the shoulder.] Please come over for dinner! I love you! [Squeals.]
Morty Rogers: Yeah. Dinner sounds great! [Chuckles.] Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night?
Finn: Sure.
Morty Rogers: All right! Let's do it!
BMO: Oh, ooh! And when Chips trips over the turtle, it was so funny! But also sad. It made me think about the fragility of my own life.
Morty Rogers: [Looks out the window to the clouds covering the moon.] Just a little more...
Jake: [Holds up rice patties and a dead fish] Hey, y'all ready for some sushi burgers?
Morty Rogers: Mm, I don't eat burgers. Got any chips and ice cream?
Jake: Uh..Sure. I just sculpted these buns though.
BMO: [Bangs their fist on the table.] Give the man what he wants! Soo, is your name Chips and Ice cream?
Morty Rogers: My name is Morty Rogers.
BMO: [Nods.] I see.
Jake: [Carrying four bowls of chips and ice cream.] Okay! Food's done. [Finn and BMO cheer]
Morty Rogers: Let's all dig in! [Jake begins to eat the chips and ice cream.] Yes, eat it. Eat that chips and ice cream.
BMO: Oh, yes sir! [Begins eating chips and ice cream.]
Morty Rogers: [Looks out the window to the moon showing through the clouds and gasps.] It's time. [Takes off his turban to reveal Chips and Ice Cream.]
Chips: [Looks to Ice Cream.]Chips chips chips?
Ice Cream: Ice cream ice cream.
BMO: No...Flipping...Way!
Morty Rogers: [Stands from his seat.] By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, I command these two imps that have taken possession of my ears to transfer onto the head of the being who is directly across from me [Steps forwards and aligns his shadow with Jake's]and is currently eating chips and ice cream!
Chips: Chips chips?!
Ice Cream: Ice cream...
Morty Rogers: Huh [Touches his ears.] It worked! I'm a free bear! [Laughs hysterically,jumps out the window and leaves.]
Jake: Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches.
Finn: Uh... Don't worry, man. I'm gonna pretend they're not even there.
Chips: Chips!
Ice Cream: Ice cream!
BMO: [Bangs a beat out on the table.]This is the greatest day of my liiife!
Jake: Maybe if I put a towel over my head they'll go to sleep. [Grabs a towel from the wardrobe.]
Finn: Huh. What's on your head? I don't even notice it.
Jake: Heh. Yeah, okay. [Puts the towel over Chips and Ice Cream]
Chips: [Muffled.] Chips chips.
Ice Cream: [Muffled.] Ice cream.
BMO: [Wakes up to crying.] Huh?
Chips: [Crying.]Chips...[Sniffles] Chips...!
Chips: Chips! Chips chips chips. Chips! Chips chips?!
Ice Cream: [Wakes up and groans.] Ice cream?
Chips: Chips chips! Chips chips chips chips chips!
Ice Cream: [Whispering.] Ice cream? Ice cream ice cream ice cream!
Jake: [Grumbles and sits up while Chips and Ice Cream continue to talk.] All right, that's enough. They're going outside. [Jake stretches Chips and Ice Cream outside and lays them on the grass.]
BMO: Nooooooo!
Chips: Chips.
Ice Cream: [Sighing.] Ice cream.
BMO: [Comes outside with a small blanket.] Poor Chips and Ice Cream. [Puts the blanket on top of Chips and Ice Cream.]
Ice Cream: [Singing] Ah, ah, ah, ah ice cream.
Chips: [Singing] Chips chips chips chips...
Finn: [Sighs.] Why are you up so early?
Jake: [Grabbing at some fabric.] I got to get to the farmer's market before all the choice stuff is gone.
Finn: Oh. Why is BMO on your head?
Jake: He is?!
Chips: [Speaking into BMO's microphone.]Chips chips.
Ice Cream: [Speaking into BMO's microphone.]Ice cream.
BMO: I'm onto something important!
Jake: Quit clownin' around.
BMO: [Running off Jake's head.]Okay. I was done anyhow. [Goes to sit on the Tree Fort floor and plays Chip's voice on their screen.] [Distorted] Chips chips.
Jake: So, you want me to pick up any snacks?
Finn: Yeah, maybe some ketchup chips?
Chips: [Smacks Jake on the eye.] Chips.
Finn: And...some kale [Hesitant.] chips.
Chips: [Smacks Jake on the eye.] Chips!
Finn: And some corn... [Whispers.] chips.
Chips: [Smacks Jake on the eye.] Chips.
Jake: Okay. [Puts a light blue piece of fabric on his head like a bonnet.] Later, dude.
Finn: Later.
Chips: [Muffled.] Chips!
Ice Cream: [Muffled.] Ice cream!
Finn: [Sighs in frustration.]
Jake: [Looking at two apples.] Hmm..
Apple Merchant: Nice choice! Those are two of my faves!
Chips: [Peering out of the bonnet to look at the apple.] Chips.
Apple Merchant: Yeah, we have chips.
Ice Cream: [Peering out of the bonnet to look at the apple.] Ice cream?
Apple Merchant: Sorry. I don't have any ice cream, but I know who does. [Whistles to the Merchant to the right.] Hey, John!
John: Yo!
Apple Merchant: I gots a customer for yas. [Takes Jake's apples and says to him.]I'll bag these for ya.
John: [Hands a tub of ice cream to another customer.] Enjoy and stay awesome. [To Jake.] Yo! I got ice creams!
Ice Cream: [Looking down at the ice cream.] Ice cream?
John: I recommend the hamburger flavor. Also, the pizza flavor is tremendous!
Customer: Do you have taco?
John: One second! [Turns to get a tub of ice cream for the customer and hands it to them.] One taco flavored.
Customer: [Taking the tub of ice cream.] You have the best!
John: You have the best, out-of-this-world day. [To Jake.] What's your spectacular choice?
Morty Rogers: [Gasps.] No. No! Stay away! You can't make me take them back!
Jake: [Turns to face Morty Rogers.] Oh hey, Morty Rogers.
Ice Cream: Ice cream!
Morty Rogers: [Throws his tub of ice cream and runs away screaming. Knocks over crates of food as he runs.]
John: Tremendous.
Morty Rogers: [Runs and pants. Enters his home.] No more chips. No more ice cream. [Cuts open a can of beans.] Beans. That's what regular-sized-ear folks eat. Regular old morty Rogers... [Looks at a tub of ice cream and a bag of chips. Screams.] [Groans and shuffles. Grabs a record and plays it on the record player.]
Morty Rogers: Oh! I hope the record is not scratched or chipped. Chip. Ice cream. [Grabs buttons and sewing thread from a drawer.
Morty Rogers: [Mimicking Chips.] Chips. [Moves to wiggle the Chips sock puppet.]
Chips: Chips chips chips.
Ice Cream: Ice creaaaam.
Morty Rogers: [Mimicking Chips and Ice Cream.] Chips chips! Chip chip. Ice cream! Ice cream!
Morty Rogers: Hush! Hush! Hush! [Kicks a plate of beans and grabs the sockpuppet Chips.] Noiseless, Chips! [Grabs the sockpuppet Ice Cream.] Inaudible, Ice Cream! [Tosses the Chips and Ice Cream sock puppets on the table while crying.] Nyahah!
Finn: [Throws up his arms.] Aah! Quiet! [Slams his hands on the table.] I thought I could just ignore them, but I can't! Chips and Ice Cream have to go!
Jake: [Continues to spread mayonnaise on his piece of bread.] Listen. Even if I could find Morty Rogers again, I don't know how to get these things to go back to him or even if they want to.
Chips: Chips chips!
Ice Cream: Ice cream!
BMO: [Runs into the room.] I finished with my computations! As I thought, it's a real language they are speaking based on intonations! [Speaking to Chips and Ice Cream.] Chips? Chips chips chips! Ice cream?
BMO: [Nods.] I know what we have to do.
Morty Rogers: [Emerges from a barrel of chips and ice cream holding a mirror.] How many years did I search for a rube to take my burden? [Touches one of his ears.] What's wrong with me? You two brought me nothing but pain... [Rubs one ear gently.] And I can't stop thinking of you. But I don't want you back! [Presses the mirror to his face.] I don't want you!
Morty Rogers: [Glances around.] What's that? [Looks at the mirror.] Do you hear that? [Drops the mirror.]
Morty Rogers: [Starts to get out of the barrel.] It's like--Chips..Ice Cream. [Gets out of the barrel and exits his house.] I..must..I..must!
BMO: [Whispering.] He's here!
Jake: [Singing.] I love you, Chips and Ice Cream. I hope you never leave.
Morty Rogers: No! Those are my Chips and Ice Cream! By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, transfer those two imps that have taken possession of Jake's ears to the head of the being who is watching from the window! Chips and Ice Cream!
Finn: BMO, it's happening!
Morty Rogers: No! My Chips! And Ice Cream!
BMO: [Runs outside and opens the jar.] Free!
Morty Rogers: Noooo!
Finn: [Peering out the Tree Fort window.]Whoa.
Morty Rogers: What's going on?
BMO: Chips and Ice Cream wanted to be free. But they could only be if I interrupted the transference ritual.
Morty Rogers: Free? I'm sorry for keeping you dudes as my prisoners for so many years. [Crying.] But what am I gonna do without you?!
Chips: Chips.
Ice Cream: Ice cream.
Morty Rogers: What?
Chips: Chips!
Ice Cream: Ice cream!
Chips: Chips.
Ice Cream: Ice cream.

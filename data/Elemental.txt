[Banana Guard picks up the phone]
Banana Guard #1: You're missing hangers, too?
Banana Guard #2: Well, I don't really use hangers.
Banana Guard #1: Have you considered folding? We better call Princess Bubblegum.
[Princess Bubblegum pauses the recorded video]
Princess Bubblegum: And then I called you guys.
Finn: To find all the wire hangers?
Jake: Wouldn't you rather have us fighting evil demons or something?
Princess Bubblegum: Maybe an evil demon is stealing all the hangers.
Jake: Hmm.
Jake: [shapeshifted as a trashcan] See anything?
Finn: [inside Jake] No, it's pretty quite out there.
Jake: Yeah, but not so much in here.
Finn: Huh? What does that mean?
[Jake farts]
Finn: Oh, Jake, no!
[Jake laughs]
Finn: Wait, hold on.
[Ice King tries to break and enter "C. K. Dry Cleaners"]
Jake: It's over, Ice King!
Ice King: Oh, hi, guys.
Finn: What's going on? Is kidnapping hangers your new thing now?
Jake: Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it.
Ice King: You think this is about hangers? Really?
Finn: Well... Yeah, because you're stealing all the hangers.
Jake: You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude.
Ice King: It's about so much more! Come back to my place, and I'll explain everything.
Finn and Jake: Hmm.
Ice King: See? I dropped my keys down this deep hole. I need all these hanger guys to help me snag 'em. When I'm done, I'll return them all, and that's an ice promise.
Finn: How long has this crack been here?
Ice King: Forever. Before forever. What the... [pulled down to the crack by hanger] Oh! Something's got me!
Finn: Let go of the hanger!
Ice King: Huh?
Jake: Let go!
Ice King: Oh.
Jake: This calls for an investigation.
Ice King: All right. Stand back! [forms a circular saw with the power of his ice magic] Follow me, fellas!
[Finn, Jake and Ice King keeps walking down through the tunnel while Ice King drills ahead]
Ice King: Watch your heads.
[Ice thuds]
Ice King: Holy moly! Do you know what this extra square footage means when I decide to sell?
Finn: [looks into the icy orb]There's something in here.
Jake: What is it?
Finn: I don't know.
Ice King: Well, no rest for the sexy.
Jake: That's not the expression.
[Ice King drills against the surface of the orb]
Ice King: Boy, this is strong. A lot stronger than my ice. [grunts]
[Orb cracks, and explodes]
Patience St. Pim: [gasps] Dudes!
Finn: Hello.
Patience St. Pim: What year is this?
Finn: Uh, nobody really keeps time like that.
Patience St. Pim: It worked! I mean, I feel like it worked. This is the future, right?
Finn: Who are you? You're like a beautiful Ice King.
Jake: Oh, boy, here we go.
Ice King: Back off, son! I saw her first!
Patience St. Pim: Chill, you guys. [chuckles] "Chill"? Get it? I'm Patience St. Pim, the ICE ELEMENTAL! Whoo! [sprays icy particles] Did you see that? I made ice... with my hands.
Finn: I'm Finn the human, and this is Jake the dog.
Jake: Hello.
Patience St. Pim: Who's a good boy?
Ice King: Ahem. They call me the Ice King. I also make ice. [tiny ice pops out from Ice King's finger]
Finn: He's been using his powers a lot today.
Patience St. Pim: [jumps off the boat] Hup! Well, I think you're pretty groovy. Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna be my acolyte?
Ice King: Sure. What's that? Like a boyfriend?
Patience St. Pim: More like an intern.
Ice King: Oh.
Patience St. Pim: Uh, no, you're right. It is more like a boyfriend.
Ice King: Cool.
Patience St. Pim: YOU'RE COOL! Dialed in, you know?
Ice King: [chuckles] Huh, what?
Patience St. Pim: Yeah. Uh, hey, this might be a weird question, but do you know where the slime, candy, and fire dudes are?
Finn: [whispers]She's talking about the princesses.
Jake: [whispers]I'm starting to get a weird feeling.
Ice King: Oh, you must mean Slime Princess, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess.
Patience St. Pim: [intrigued]Princesses?
Ice King: We're like this!
Patience St. Pim: That is so fun. Okay now, this next request may sound super sketch.
Ice King: Okay.
Patience St. Pim: I need you to round them up and bring them back here. Like, even if they don't want to come. You think you could do that?
Ice King: Are you kidding? That's in my wheelhouse, right up my alley! Classic Ice King.
Patience St. Pim: So, wait, is it in your wheelhouse or up your alley?
Ice King: Classic Ice King.
Finn: Hold on a minute. You can't make Simon start kidnapping princesses again.
Jake: Yeah, he's semi-reformed.
Patience St. Pim: Excuse me for a second, boyfriend.
Finn: Okay Jake---
[Finn and Jake are immobilized instantly with Patience St. Pim's ice power, then Patience St. Pim carves Finn and Jake's respective initials on the ice orb capturing them]
Ice King: Wow, you got their initials on there, and look at those shapes. We're kind of like a power couple.
Patience St. Pim: Get me those princesses.
Ice King: You got it, boss.

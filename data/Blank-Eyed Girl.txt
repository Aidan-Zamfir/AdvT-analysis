Finn: This is gonna work. Just trust me, a'ight?
Jake: Ugh.
Finn: Do as I do.
[girls exhale, Finn inhales deeply]
Finn: Boy, I just love walking through our delightfully not-creepy doorway. Don't you, Jake?
Jake: Uh-huh, uh-huh. [shrieking]
Finn: Walking through the not-creepy air to my not-creepy couch, sitting on my not-creepy butt.
BMO: [chuckles]Your butt is kinda creepy.
Finn: I say 'creepy' is just another label we use to distance ourselves from stuff we don't understand. Or that it reminds us of something in ourselves that we're not comfortable with. I mean, it just ain't an actual thing, you know? Unless you choose to believe it. Right, Jake?
Jake: It's baloney! It's baloney! It's Starchy's baloney! I just got to think of something wholesome.
Lady Rainicorn: (as Jake's imagination) [speaks korean] 파이 먹자. (Let's eat a pie.)
[Jake screams]

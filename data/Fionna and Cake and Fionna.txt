Finn: These ghoul dudes take the form of whatever you're thinking about.
[A ghoul emerges from the water and turns into a giant sandwich. Finn slices it with his sword and it evaporates into smoke. Another ghoul turns into an evil pretzel with chainsaw arms, which Finn stabs.]
BMO: An angry -- no, shy shark baby.
[A ghoul leaps out of the water and turns into a shy shark baby. Finn kills it.]
Finn: What if life was always just constant fun times on the river?
Jake: Let's never do anything boring ever again.
BMO: Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag-- [BMO's alarm starts beeping.] Time for Ice King's boring book reading.
Finn: Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us.
Jake: I kind of dig getting loosely adapted.
[Jake grows some legs and exits the river. The scene changes to the Library, where Ice King is reading to a small audience.]
Ice King: Fionna spoke with the voice of an angelic choir. "You can have the rest of the screaming chili cheese dip if you want," she said. [Sniffles] "It's totally fine." The end.
[There is no reaction from the audience.]
Ice King: [Slamming the book shut] I said "the end"!
[There is polite applause.]
Turtle Princess: Let's get some questions.
Banana Guard: [Raising hand] Where do your ideas come from?
Ice King: They're beamed into my melon at night - same as everybody else. Next!
Unknown voice: I have more of a criticism than a question.
Ice King: [Angrily] I am very open to criticism!
Unknown voice: Your story was completely wrong.
Ice King: [Looking for the source of the voice] And how would you know?
Unknown voice: I know... because I am... Fionna!
[An elderly "Fionna" emerges from behind a potted plant. The audience turns and gasps.]
"Fionna": I can show you what really happened. It's all on this tape!
Audience: Ooh!
Banana Guard: What format is that?
[A VCR is heard starting up. The scene changes. Fionna and Cake are exploring a swampy area.]
Fionna: According to this map, we're very close. There's the door.
[They reach a small lake. There is a door on an island in the middle of the lake. Cake stretches them over to the door and Fionna tries the knob.]
Fionna: Aw, it's locked.
Cake: I'll get us in with key... eye!
[Cake stretches her eye into the keyhole, forms fists and a face on her eye, and punches the pins to pieces.]
Cake: Bam! "Eye" got it. You get it, Fionna?
Fionna: Yeah, but it's a stretch.
[The audience in the library is seen laughing at the joke.]
Other Fionna: [Quietly] There I am.
[The door creaks open and Fionna and Cake enter a dungeon containing a green sarcophagus.]
Fionna: [Sighs] Next time we find a map lying in the backyard, we should think twice.
Cake: At least we get this fancy coffin.
[The scene changes to the Tree House, where Fionna and Cake have placed the sarcophagus in the treasure room.]
Cake: How's it look?
Fionna: It's a decent addition to the treasure vestibule but still kind of a letdown.
Cake: You know what's never a letdown? Cookie sauce review party.
Fionna: Yeah! Cookie dip. Screaming chili cheese versus sriracha ranch.
[Fionna and Cake exit. The lid of the sarcophagus creaks as it is lifted by a mysterious hand. The screen cuts to static and then black, as the "Fionna" in the real world stops the tape. The lights in the library are turned back on and the audience begins speculating.]
Peppermint Butler: Was it real?
Banana Guard: Who was filming all that?
Gunter: Wenk, wenk.
BMO: Needs more hunks!
Finn: Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions. [He approaches "Fionna".] Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m!
[Ice King crawls between Finn's legs and throws him out of the way.]
Ice King: Fionna! I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket?
"Fionna": That was such a long time ago.
Ice King: But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along!
[A flashback is seen of Abracadanielle stealing jewelry and hissing.]
Banana Guard: Can I also ask a question?
Ice King: Besties only.
Banana Guard: I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape.
Ice King: Oh, yeah, can we?
"Fionna": I don't think so.
[Ice King and the banana guard look dejected.]
"Fionna": All right, just a little more.
[She continues the tape and the VCR whirs to life. On the screen, a tiny "mummy" emerges from the sarcophagus and yawns. Fionna spots the mummy while she's climbing the ladder.]
Fionna: Oh... my... glob. It's a mummy!
"Mummy": That's right. I'm a mummy!
Fionna: Aww.
Cake: Yeah, you are. And a real cutie, too.
"Mummy": I'm not cute! I'm horrible! [Groans menacingly.]
Fionna: Wanna hang?
[Other Fionna stops the VCR again.]
"Fionna": Okay, that's enough.
Ice King and Banana Guard: Aw!
Ice King: I want to see more.
"Fionna": I don't want to wear it out. It's my only copy. And it's very important to me.
Turtle Princess: Library closes in five. [Flicking the lights on and off] Click, click, click.
Ice King: So, where you heading now?
"Fionna": Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump.
Ice King: I have a TV. My crib is equipped.
"Fionna": Oh, really?
Ice King: Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna.
[The scene changes to the Ice Kingdom. Ice King is showing "Fionna" around.]
Ice King: This is the sweet spot. My roo-- [Noticing mess] Oh! I wasn't expecting guests. [Chuckles] Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right?
"Fionna" admires a poster on the wall which reads "Fionna & Cake and the Haunted Baguette 2".
Ice King: Nice, huh?
"Fionna": So, this is my room now.
Ice King: Only the best for Fionna.
[They enter the bathroom.]
Ice King: Oh yeah, I like this room too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it-- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge!
"Fionna": That's what heroes do.
Ice King: You're a so much better hero than Finn.
"Fionna": I know.
Ice King: Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat? [He begins calling for her.] Cake? Cake?
"Fionna": Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
Ice King: Oh, okay.
"Fionna": Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna and Cake tapes.
Ice King: Sorry, no can do.
"Fionna": What? Don't you have tapes?
Ice King: Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private.
"Fionna": Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure?
Ice King: Yay! I'll get snacks.
[Again, there is a crackle of static and then the tape continues. Fionna, Cake, and the "mummy" are dancing and laughing together in the Tree House.]
"Mummy": [Groans.]
Fionna: Hey, what's wrong?
"Mummy": [Dramatically] I have... a curse!
Fionna and Cake: [Together] Oh no.
Fionna: How can we save you, tiny mummy?
"Mummy": The curse can only be broken by strong black coffee and fancy muffins from Breakfast Kingdom.
Fionna: I know that place. It has a really long line on weekends.
"Mummy": Yes! That sounds like the one. Be a hero and fetch unto me the sacred breakfast.
Cake: Don't you worry, little guy.
Fionna: We'll save you!
[Cake stretches the two of them through a window and outside. The "mummy" laughs and begins reading a magazine while she lounges on the table. The tape stops and static crackles on the screen.]
"Fionna": Okay, that's the end of the tape.
Ice King: Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater. [Chuckles] Wrapped up -- mummies.
"Fionna": Yeah, well, there's no more, so... [She removes the tape from the player.] You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep.
Ice King: I did know that.
"Fionna": See you in the morning.
[Ice King is focused on the tape that "Fionna" is holding.]
Ice King: [Suspiciously] Okay.
[Later on, "Fionna" is seen sleeping on the couch. Ice King enters the room with a sandwich.]
Ice King: [Whispering] Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack.
["Fionna" snores. Ice King eyes the tape she is clutching. He nibbles the sandwich until it matches the size and shape of the tape and then swaps the two items covertly and exits. He puts earphones in and starts the tape.]
Fionna: [On the tape] Mummy, we're home.
Ice King: [Gasps] I knew it.
Fionna: Where did it go?
Cake: Maybe it had to go back into its coffin Dracula-style.
Fionna: Mummy?
Cake: We got you breakfast.
[The sarcophagus is empty.]
Fionna: Hmm.
Cake: Shh! What's that?
[Cake pushes aside some treasure piles to reveal the "mummy" filling a bag with coins and gems.]
"Mummy": Nyeh!
Fionna: That's our treasure!
"Mummy": Stay away. You'll get cursed. [Groans menacingly]
Fionna: I take the curse off of me and put it back on you.
"Mummy": You understand nothing of mummy curses! [She flees.]
Fionna: Our treasure!
[The "mummy" runs past Cake and knocks a bag of muffins out of her hands.]
Cake: Our muffins!
[Cake catches all the muffins and steps on a loose end of the "mummy's" wrapping. It unravels, revealing that the mummy was actually Queen of Ooo all along.]
Queen of Ooo: Uhh... Do not look upon a naked mummy. It's bad luck.
Fionna and Cake: [Together] Queen of Ooo?!
Queen of Ooo: That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really.
[The tape ends.]
Ice King: Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's... a mummy! [Ice King looks over at the couch and sees that "Fionna" is missing.] Aah!
[Ice King picks up a fly swatter defensively and looks around nervously. He hears "Fionna" rummaging through his tapes in another room.]
"Fionna": Come on. They're all just him?
Ice King: Imposter! Reveal yourself! [He begins swatting "Fionna" in the face.]
"Fionna": Aah! Knock it off!
Ice King: You're the knock-off!
"Fionna": What?
Ice King: You're not Fionna!
"Fionna": How did you--
Ice King: Show me your true form!
["Fionna" yields and removes her hat and hair, revealing that she has a pair of rabbit ears.]
Ice King: Aha! Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be?
Rabbit Lady: No kind! I'm just an old lady.
Ice King: Who likes to dress up as Fionna?
Rabbit Lady: It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus I look really good in this outfit. [Narrating a flashback] Look, I used to be very shy, tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like a hundred times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes.
Ice King: What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes.
Rabbit Lady: I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries.
Ice King: If I met them, I'd definitely record it.
Rabbit Lady: Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something.
Ice King: You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Ice King. [Crying]
Rabbit Lady: Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Ice King: You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never.
Rabbit Lady: Oh, glob, you're right. I'm not like Fionna. I'm the mummy! Oh glob! [She exits.]
Gunter: Wenk.
Ice King: Huh? Well, that was disheartening.
Rabbit Lady: [In the distance] Forgive me, Fionna!
[Ice King yawns and carries Gunter to bed. As he sleeps, a red beam of light shoots through his window and directly into his head, carrying images of Fionna and Cake into his brain.]
Fionna: [Echoing from the light beam] Cake, what time is it?
Gunter: Wenk.

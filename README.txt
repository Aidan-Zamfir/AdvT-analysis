Selenium webscraping & data analysis (learning) project.

-Scraping functionality is complete; in future will scrape differently so that episodes will be in order.

-NLP of text to find connections between characters
-Network of relationships between characters

NEXT STEPS:
-In the future should access each character (rather than just mains),
scrape through each episode, compile all data into a df and create a large
network graph of relationships between all characters
